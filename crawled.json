  "abstract": "This work presents topological regularization (TR), a geometric framework for controlling ultraviolet divergences in gravitational loop corrections to the Higgs fermion sector. The method embeds flat spacetime into a compact four dimensional manifold, introducing a curvature induced high energy cutoff that preserves both Lorentz invariance and causality. The regulator is determined by the manifold's Euler characteristic, ensuring power law suppression of short distance modes without breaking spacetime symmetries. Applied to one and two loop processes, TR yields finite corrections to fermion self energies, Yukawa couplings, and curvature dependent operators, with leading contributions set entirely by topological properties. Beyond its role as a regulator, TR naturally encodes a duality between ultraviolet and infrared scales and admits a thermal interpretation linked to the Unruh effect. While the framework is universal in principle, its current implementation relies on a spherical embedding and has been tested only in the soft graviton limit. The predicted signals are highly suppressed, posing experimental challenges, yet TR offers a symmetry preserving path toward probing Planck-scale physics within effective field theory."

  "abstract": "Quantum sensing with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond promises to revolutionize biological research and medical diagnostics. Thanks to their high sensitivity, NV sensors could, in principle, detect specific binding events with metabolites and proteins in a massively parallel and label-free way, avoiding the complexity of mass spectrometry. Realizing this vision has been hindered by the lack of quantum sensor arrays that unite high-density spatial multiplexing with uncompromising biochemical specificity. Here, we introduce a scalable quantum biosensing platform that overcomes these barriers by integrating the first multiplexed DNA microarray directly onto a subnanometer antifouling diamond surface. The 7x7 DNA array, patterned onto a diamond chip, enables simultaneous detection of 49 distinct biomolecular features with high spatial resolution and reproducibility, as verified by fluorescence microscopy. Molecular recognition is converted into a quantum signal via a target-induced displacement mechanism in which hybridization removes a Gd$^{3+}$-tagged DNA strand, restoring NV center spin relaxation times (T$_1$) and producing a binary quantum readout. This platform establishes a new paradigm for high-throughput, multiplexed quantum biosensing and opens the door to advanced molecular diagnostics and large-scale quantum sensor networks operable in complex biological environments."

  "abstract": "Temperature-responsive polymeric micelles have great potential in drug delivery, enhancing therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic toxicity. This study investigates the self-assembly of poly(ethylene glycol)-poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PEG-PNIPAM) block copolymers as nanocarriers for Doxorubicin (DOX) using coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CG-MD) simulations. We systematically examined the effects of polymer chain length and hydrophilic/hydrophobic balance on micelle formation, stability, and drug encapsulation efficiency. PEG-PNIPAM copolymers self-assembled above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST), forming stable micelles with varying morphologies. Our findings revealed that PEG enhances micelle hydration and stability, while PNIPAM improves drug retention but may hinder controlled release. Increasing PNIPAM or PEG length significantly increased micelle size, with DOX preferentially localizing in the PEG-rich outer shell, enhancing solubility and preventing aggregation. The DOX diffusion coefficient ranged from $10^{-8}$ to $10^{-9}$ cm$^{2}$s$^{-1}$, reflecting drug release dynamics. Structural and thermodynamic analyses confirmed spontaneous DOX encapsulation, with PEG-PNIPAM micelles providing a favorable environment for drug loading. Mean square displacement (MSD), radial distribution function (RDF), and solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) analyses highlighted the role of PEG in controlled drug release and PNIPAM in drug binding. These molecular-level insights underscore the potential of fine-tuning PEG-PNIPAM compositions for enhanced drug delivery, paving the way for precision cancer therapies."

  "abstract": "Depth electrodes used in stereoelectroencephalography (sEEG) and deep-brain stimulation (DBS) are essential tools for neural recording and stimulation. Traditional designs have limited spatial resolution, typically 8 to 16 cylindrical contacts (0.8 to 1.0 mm diameter) along a 5 to 10 cm shaft, restricting recordings from small or localized populations. Recent high-density, directional electrodes (HDsEEG) enable finer localization of local field potentials (LFPs) and spike timing. Yet, characterizing their directional sensitivity and validating modeling tools for lead field (LF) analysis remain critical. We compare finite element method (FEM) LF modeling of a novel HD-sEEG electrode using two tools: a commercial solver (ANSYS) and an open-source pipeline (Brainstorm-DUNEuro). Goals: (i) validate against analytical solutions, (ii) assess solver differences, and (iii) characterize HDsEEG directional sensitivity. LFs were modeled in simple and bio-relevant scenarios. Using Helmholtz reciprocity, we computed LFs by (a) electrode-based stimulation with ANSYS and (b) source-based recording with Brainstorm-DUNEuro. First, a multi-sphere head model with known solutions tested the solver's accuracy. Next, an HDsEEG electrode in a homogeneous conductor was simulated. Directional effects were assessed by comparing sensitivity with vs. without the insulating substrate. Source localization performance was also compared between HDsEEG and standard electrodes. Both solvers closely matched analytic solutions. In realistic settings, LF distributions were highly similar. Modeling showed clear directional sensitivity: contacts facing a source had higher sensitivity than those shadowed, reflecting a substrate shielding effect that vanished when the substrate was conductive. Crucially, HDsEEG improved source localization, as voltage differences across contacts provided robust directional LF information."

  "abstract": "In photocatalysis, the reusability limit of catalysts can contribute to secondary pollution, posing ecological risks. Addressing this, the present study explores the integration of additive manufacturing with photocatalysis by decorating Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ onto a 3D-printed hematite scaffold (Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$@3DH) for the degradation of cresols. The 3D-printed hematite grid, fabricated via direct ink writing, exhibited excellent rheological behavior ($\\tau\\gamma = 24$ Pa), allowing precise shape retention. The sintered Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ was subsequently immobilized via a facile dip-coating method. Under optimized conditions, the composite achieved 99.78\\% degradation of 20 mg/L p-cresol within 240 min of irradiation. Notably, hematite served as a porous substrate and contributed to photocatalytic activity. Density functional theory simulations with Hubbard correction (DFT+U) indicated an interfacial charge transfer of approximately -0.9 electrons from hematite to Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$, confirming a S-scheme heterojunction between hematite and Bi$_4$O$_5$I$_2$ semiconductors, validating experimental observations. The composite demonstrated strong performance across varied water matrices and in the presence of other cresol isomers. It also retained 84.28\\% degradation efficiency after 10 cycles, with negligible catalyst leaching. Furthermore, in vitro and in silico ecotoxicity analyses revealed reduced toxicity of the degradation products. The current work presents a novel and scalable strategy, advancing the use of earth-abundant hematite minerals in sustainable environmental remediation."
