  "abstract": "We show that a minimally extended varying-speed-of-light (meVSL) cosmology can alleviate the Hubble tension through a single parameter, b. This parameter both shortens the sound horizon at the drag epoch and modifies cosmological time dilation for transients, Delta_t_obs=(1+z)^n Delta_t_emit with n=1-b/4. The reduction in r_d raises the early-universe-inferred H_0 from CMB/BAO analyses, while departures of n from unity provide an independent, time-domain probe of b. Using Fisher forecasts for a DES-like survey, we estimate the supernova sample size required to detect sub-percent deviations in n under realistic statistical and systematic uncertainties. For illustration, b=0.03 yields z_drag = 1108 and r_d = 135 Mpc, consistent with H_0=~73 km/s/Mpc. We conclude that current and upcoming time-domain surveys can place competitive constraints on b and, jointly with CMB/BAO, provide a self-consistent observational test of meVSL's ability to alleviate the H_0 discrepancy."

  "abstract": "The USMEG-EFT framework~\\cite{ChishtieEFT2025,ChishtieBreakdown2023} provides systematic quantum gravity through with 4D General Relativity (GR) achieving Standard Model-gravity unification. This work examines Einstein-Cartan theory against McKeon et al.'s claims~\\cite{BrandtFrenkelMcKeon2024,McKeonBrandtFrenkel2025} regarding its viability for unification. McKeon et al.'s 2024 analysis omitted key interaction terms, missing Einstein-Cartan's central content. Their 2025 claim that unification requires Einstein-Cartan is incorrect. When fermions are included, Einstein-Cartan generates non-renormalizable four-fermion interactions producing catastrophic quartic divergences $\\sim \\kappa^4\\Lambda^4$. Precision experiments exclude the theory: MICROSCOPE constrains equivalence principle violations at $10^{-15}$ while Einstein-Cartan predicts $10^{-12}$ effects. In contrast to these claims, the USMEG-EFT framework achieves unification using standard 4D GR through constraints, producing finite results with calculable coefficients while remaining experimentally compatible."

  "abstract": "Inertial waves in fluid regions of planets and stars play an important role in their dynamics and evolution, through energy, heat and angular momentum transport and mixing of chemicals. While inertial wave propagation in flows prescribed by solid-body rotation is well-understood, natural environments are often characterized by convection or zonal flows. In these more realistic configurations, we do not yet understand the propagation of inertial waves or their transport properties. In this work, we focus on the interaction between inertial waves and geostrophic currents, which has thus far only been investigated using ray theory, where the wave length is assumed to be small relative to the length scale of the current, or averaging/statistical approaches. We develop a quasi-two-dimensional analytical model to investigate the reflection and transmission of inertial waves in the presence of a localized geostrophic shear layer of arbitrary width and compare our theoretical findings to a set of numerical simulations. We demonstrate that, in contrast to ray theory predictions, partial reflections occur even in subcritical shear layers and tunnelling with almost total transmission is possible in supercritical shear layers, if the layer is thin compared to the wavelength. That is, supercritical shear layers act as low-pass filters for inertial wave beams allowing the low-wavenumber waves to travel through. Thus, our analytical model allows us to predict interactions between inertial waves and geostrophic shear layers not addressed by ray-based or statistical theories and conceptually understand the behaviour of the full wavefield around and inside such layers."

  "abstract": "Uplink pre-compensation in ground-to-satellite optical links remains a problem, with an appropriate measurement of the wavefront error in the uplink path often not being available. We present a method that uses successive measurements of the readily accessible downlink beam to perform a tomographic reconstruction of the volume of atmosphere common to the downlink beam and the ground-station field-of-view. These measurements are done through the existing downlink wavefront sensor. From here, an estimate of the wavefront error along the uplink path can be obtained. We evaluate this method in simulation over representative atmospheric conditions and find good performance, especially for situations where the satellite point-ahead angle is many times greater than the atmosphere's isoplanatic angle. Compared to pre-compensation directly using the downlink phase, we find that this method estimates the uplink path with a residual mean-square wavefront error that is up to 8.6 times less. The hardware simplicity of this method makes it a promising solution for uplink pre-compensation implementations targeted at optical communications."

  "abstract": "Comprehensive Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) as a tool to account for the full range of environmental impacts of resource use in commodities or services is a first step in reducing these impacts. There is an increasing necessity to account for these aspects in the planning, running and end-of-life of scientific experiments and research infrastructure. In the following, the concept for an Open Research Life Cycle Assessment (ORLCA) repository is presented to support this endeavour. It is designed to comply fully with the principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR)."
