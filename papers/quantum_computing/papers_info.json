    "summary": "This article highlights quantum Internet computing as referring to\ndistributed quantum computing over the quantum Internet, analogous to\n(classical) Internet computing involving (classical) distributed computing over\nthe (classical) Internet. Relevant to quantum Internet computing would be areas\nof study such as quantum protocols for distributed nodes using quantum\ninformation for computations, quantum cloud computing, delegated verifiable\nblind or private computing, non-local gates, and distributed quantum\napplications, over Internet-scale distances.",
