    "summary": "Multiphase flow in porous media occurs in several disciplines including\npetroleum reservoir engineering, petroleum systems' analysis, and CO$_2$\nsequestration. While simulations often use a fully implicit discretization to\nincrease the time step size, restrictions on the time step often exist due to\nnon-convergence of the nonlinear solver (e.g. Newton's method). Here this\nproblem is addressed for the Buckley-Leverett equations, which model\nincompressible, immiscible, two-phase flow with no capillary potential. The\nequations are recast as a gradient flow using the phase-field method, and a\nconvex energy splitting scheme is applied to enable large timesteps, even for\nhigh degrees of heterogeneity in permeability and viscosity. By using the\nphase-field formulation as a homotopy map, the underlying hyperbolic flow\nequations can be solved with large timesteps. For a heterogeneous test problem,\nthe new homotopy method allows the timestep to be increased by more than six\norders of magnitude relative to the unmodified equations while maintaining\nconvergence.",
