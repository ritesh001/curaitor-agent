    "summary": "The escalating plastic waste crisis demands global action, yet mechanical\nrecycling - currently the most prevalent strategy - remains severely\nunderutilized. Only a small fraction of the total plastic waste is recycled in\nthis manner, largely due to the significant variability in recycled plastics'\nmechanical properties. This variability stems from compositional fluctuations\nand impurities introduced throughout the materials' lifecycle and the recycling\nprocess, deterring industries with stringent product specifications from\nadopting recycled plastics on a wider scale. To overcome this challenge, we\npropose a composite structure inspired by nacre's microstructure - a natural\nmaterial known for its exceptional mechanical performance despite its inherent\nrandomness across multiple length scales. This bio-inspired design features\nstiff recycled plastic platelets (\"bricks\") within a soft polymeric matrix\n(\"mortar\"). We use a tension-shear-chain model to capture the deformation\nmechanism of the structure, and demonstrate, through a case study of commercial\nstretch wrap, that the proposed design reduces variability in effective elastic\nmodulus by 89.5% and in elongation at break by 42%, while achieving the same\nmodulus as the virgin stretch wrap material. These findings highlight the\npotential of the proposed bio-inspired design to enhance the mechanical\nperformance of recycled plastics, but also demonstrate that a universally\napplicable, chemistry-agnostic approach can substantially broaden their\napplications, paving the way for sustainable plastic waste management.",
