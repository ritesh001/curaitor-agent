Understanding their delicate balance of Coulomb forces, short-range repulsion, and electronic polarization, particularly regarding the role that electronic fluctuations play in their structure and dynamics, is critical to predictively designing molten salts for applications of interest. We investigate the importance of electronic fluctuations in molten AgI using density functional theory, a universal machine learning model (Orb), and a classical, empirical pairwise model of interionic interactions. We find that directional polarization fluctuations of iodide ions enhance Ag+ diffusion, manifesting as enhanced force fluctuations and structure in the time-dependent friction experienced by the cations. The coupling between iodide polarization fluctuations and silver diffusion creates a dynamic asymmetry; Ag+ motion is tightly linked to the instantaneous polarization of neighboring I-, whereas I- dynamics are relatively unperturbed by electronic fluctuations. For all structural and dynamic quantities investigated, the Orb model is in excellent agreement with density functional theory-based simulations, highlighting the ability of this universal neural network potential to capture many-body polarization effects. In contrast, the empirical force field fails to reproduce key structural and dynamic quantities involving cations, ultimately because it neglects dynamic electronic fluctuations. Our findings connect liquid=state ionic dynamics with the ""electronic paddle-wheel"" mechanism of ionic diffusion in superionic solids and motivate further exploration of polarization fluctuation effects in complex electrolytes and ionic liquids.

The ionic conductivity is plotted on natural logarithmic scale as a function of inverse temperature. The grey circles stand for visual guidance of ionic conductivity values at different temperatures and red circles indicate the extrapolated value of ionic conductivity at 300 K. The estimated determination coefficient, R2 = 0.99 and 0.96, indicates that 99% and 96% of the variance in the temperature dependent ionic conductivity is well captured by the deep learning model.  18 Building on the mean-squared displacement and ionic conductivity analysis, a comparative analysis of displacement magnitudes across the three structures can also highlight a significant difference in lithium migration. Indeed, the disordered α-LZC consistently shows the highest displacement values compared to βLZC, suggesting the origin of the difference in ionic conductivity. Further comparison between collective (Equation (7)), comprising self- and distinct-correlation terms, and individual ion displacements (Equation (8)) may provide additional and deeper insights into the presence and magnitude of ionic correlation effects. The larger discrepancies between collective and individual displacement observed in α-LZCs may be a sign of stronger correlation effects contributing substantially to ionic conduction, whereas the similarity between the displacements for β-LZC may indicate that ion transport is predominantly governed by uncorrelated rather than by correlated motion. To quantify these observations, we further estimated the Haven’s ratio (Equation (12)), which measures the degree of correlated ionic motion. The computed Haven’s ratio values for the LZC phases were found to be consistently below unity, particularly for α-LZC structures, confirming the presence of significant interion ic correlation effects. This result indicates the necessity of considering correlated contributions, as relying solely on individual ionic motion would underestimate the ionic conductivity and activation energies. In contrast, for β-LZC the degree of the correlated motion approached unity, indicating that correlation effects are minimal, and individual ionic dynamics dominates in overall transport behavior. This interpretation aligns with the m ore pronounced linear curves observed for α-LZCs correlated displacements (Figure S6), whereas the noisier, less -defined profile for β-LZC curves reflects weaker correlation effects. The correlated ionic motion in α-LZCs can be attributed to mutual lithium-ion"

The solid electrolytes investigated have been inorganic lithium-ion conductive ceramics (LICCs), polymer or polymer gel electrolytes, or composite electrolytes with inorganic and organic components. LICCs can have conductivities greater than liquid electr olytes, but are brittle, while polymer elect rolytes are flexible and malleable but have poor ionic conductivity, the latter of which can be enhanced by addition of liquids to form gels. Composite electrolytes were proposed to combine advantages of the LICCs and polymers 1. However, there appears to be a barrier to Li + ion migration between the inorganic and organic phase, with the resistance at the interface limiting the total ionic conductivity. The mechanism of Li + ion conduction is different in liquid, polymer and lithium -ion conducting ceramic (LICC) electrolytes. Li+ ion diffusion in liquid electrolytes occurs via vehicular motion of solvated ions in dilute solutions and by structural transport via solvent or anion exchange in concentration solutions (>3M salt).2 In polymer electrolytes the Li + ions are solvated by the polymer chains and their motion is coupled to the slow chain dynamics 3. In LICCs, Li + ion transport occurs through point defects in channels of a mobile sublattice that is surrounded by an immobile anionic lattice, via vacancy, interstitial or interstitialsubstitutional exchange mechanisms.4 Conductivity can be enhanced in LICCS by the creation of vacancies or interstitial ions by doping, or by homovalent/isovalent substitution, which affects defect creation by changing the potential energy of the conducting ions.5 In the case of soft-solid crystals, Li+ ions also migrate by a hopping mechanism in the channels formed by the organic matrix, with the anions migrating in their own channels.6 We have shown that decreased Li+···Li+ distance and unobstructed anion channels increase ionic conductivity.7 As in the case of LICCs, isovalent doping (replacement of AsF6- with N(SO2CF3)2-) 8 and aliovalent doping (AsF6- with SiF6-2)9 in (PEO)6LiFX6 channel structures increases ionic conductivity by 1.5-2 orders of magnitude, as does doping (by ~"

This comparison highlights that enhanced GB conductivity is not simply correlated with free volume, but can occur from specific structural motifs that enable collective transport.

We first investigated how the gate voltage influences ionic conductance, finding evidence of gate dependent modulation of ion selectivity under different bias polarities. Next, by applying a salt concentration gradient across the nanochannels, we demonstrated the feasibility of this platform for osmotic energy harvesting. Finally, we tested the system for single molecule sensing, showing that linearized bovine serum albumin (BSA) produced translocation signals with notably long dwell times.

The electron transfer itself is described as a simple surface hopping process underlying a first order reaction corresponding to one of the coupled M/M$^+$ and X$^-$/X half reactions. Then, the electron transfer at the interface is combined with the self-diffusion of ions in the electrolyte solutions whose role is to supply reagents and disperse products, allowing the system to settle in a stationary non-equilibrium state.

Addition of the CNTs to the PVB film formed with KI3 ions causes a significant decrease in the impedance and an increase in the conductivity, which is shown in the Nyquist diagram by the smallest semicircle (see Fig. 8) . At the same time, the frequency dependence of the conductivity shows a sawtooth behavior in the high -frequency region, which points to the intermittent nature of charge transfer due to the formation of a clustered CNT conductive network. The DC component of the conductivity increases and remains constant up to the frequencies of ~104 rad/s. This makes a contrast to the samples without the CNTs, for which the DC component of the conductivity disappears at the frequencies of about 10 3 rad/s, indicating a more efficient ionic conductivity. This is explained b y the fact that ions have more time to relax and pass through the interfacial regions . The CNTs create topological paths facilitating ion movement (through defects, intertube gaps, surface interaction with the matrix, etc.) The high value of the phase (>45 °) in the body of the Bode phase diagram (we do not present it here since the frequency dependences of the phase are monotonous) confirms the prevalence of the capacitive response over the ionic hopping mechanism at high frequencies for all the samples. At this, the best ionic conductivity at low frequencies is characteristic of the disperse systems with CNTs. Here, the delayed DC component ( horizontal straight line, see Fig. 9) points to the existence of effective ion-conducting channels. Therefore, we may draw the following conclusions based on the analysis of the conductivity, impedance, and phase plots.

(14) to yield »s ≈ ϵϵ0(D+ + D− ) lGC  −lGC ¼D + √ ( lGC ¼D ) 2 + 2 3 ( a ¼D ) 1 2   (16) for a thin EDL and all magnitudes of the electric potential. Equation (16) is the main result of this work; further details of this derivation and a more in-depth comparison with the case of electric-ﬁeld-driven electrolyte transport in a planar channel can be found in Sec. SIV of the supplementary material. W e also give an expression for the surface charge density with respect to the electric-ﬁeld-driven electric current derived from this expression in Eq"
